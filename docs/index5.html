<p>You can see quite a lot of changes from last month. The most obvious one is the skill shop; specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting gems collects them permanently across all runs (the three types have three different values)</li>
<li>Between runs of the game, you can upgrade your skills</li>
<li>At the skill shop, you can buy new skills, upgrade existing skills, or buy other upgrades (e.g. health) with your collected gems</li>
</ul>
<p>While feedback on this ran contrary to what I hoped, I decided to make the game more roguelike (-like?) - dying three times takes you back to the beginning of the current world. Along with permanent gems, I hope this will lead players down an experience like Hades, where they adventure for a while, die, upgrade a lot, and try different builds the next run-through.</p>
<p>I also ran a limited alpha test (around six players played it and reported their feedback, incuding recordings and streams of them playing the game). Thank you all again for testing and providing feedback, be it a little or a lot - it helped me correct the course of the game and identify some much-needed things to improve upon!</p>
<p>This month, I also completed two major blocking tasks for the game: I sat down and wrote a complete end-to-end story for the game, including designing all the major characters, and some world-building/lore. Based on this, I started modifying the first world's art to fit the theme of the first world (Brightshield masjid/mosque).</p>
<p>I have a long way to go with art, which is the focus of this month: design the worlds in detail (including obstacles and monsters), and coding whatever's necessary to make it look good. This includes polishing the first world to a gleaming sheen, something I already sunk many hours into (and expect to sink many more). Already, you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>New tiles</li>
<li>A new level border</li>
<li>A large new parallax background</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope, inshaAllah (God willing), I can complete the first world art, and some of the subsequent worlds, this month. We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>This:</p>

<p>This is a prototype (mostly getting game systems working with placeholder or simple art) which I toiled away at for the last 30 days. Currently, it includes almost all the core systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect gems, dodge boulders, and make it to the exit without dying</li>
<li>Environmental elements to avoid, like explosive falling mines and lava pools</li>
<li>Procedurally-generated levels (five completely different level types)</li>
<li>Monsters, melee fighting, and two skills: an explosive fireball, and a stopwatch that lets you stop time for five turns.</li>
</ul>
<p>What's missing? My favourite roguelike element: the ability to spend gems to buy permanent upgrades and unlock new skills.</p>
<p>My current vision is something like a cross between Boulder Dash and Hades. You pick from an assortment of unlocked and upgraded skills, make a run, die, upgrade and pick an entirely different set, and try again. I planned 100 levels across ten different biomes, each with their own unique set of monsters and environmental dangers to deal with.</p>

<p>Introducing Crystal Caverns, a match-3/roguelike hybrid with persistent upgrades. In the last two months, I took this game from a rough prototype to what you see in the video. At present, the game includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bare-bones battle system: players and monsters take turns attacking.</li>
<li>A basic match-3 game with collapse mechanics, albeit you can swap any two tiles</li>
<li>Victory and defeat</li>
<li>Persistent currency (crystal shards) which you retain across battles</li>
</ul>
<p>Battles appear bare-bones at the moment, but include some depth: 
- Players can attack, critical-strike, boost defense, poison enemies, drain, and heal.
- Monster attacks affect the board in various ways (currently, they just eat random tiles).</p>
<p>That includes enough of the core game to improve upon.</p>
<p>Next month, I plan to turn my attention more towards the roguelike side of the game: generating dungeons with monsters, finding treasure (including persistent treasure), and balancing exploration with progression.</p></li>

<p>Hello! Long-time readers of this blog may notice a couple of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new, mobile-responsive theme</li>
<li>A complete restructuring of content</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to redo the blog to make it mobile-friendly, and to hange the content - instead of game development notes and game design articles, instead, I plan to focus on my games.</p>
<p>What can you expect going forward? Weekly posts show-casing the best of whatever current project I'm working on.</p>

          <li class="list-group-item"><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qr8ljtY.jpg" alt="screenshot of a verse of Qur'an in Eman Quest" width="750" height="474" /></p>
<p>I recently engaged in a conversation with someone about religion and games; specifically, about me showing, explaining, and playing the audio of verses of the Qur'an in my games. This discussion lead me to think about, question, evaluate, and eventually understand (at a deeper level) why I do this, and why I included that section in that game.</p>
<p>To summarize: I think the use of religion (specifically, elements of Islam and Muslim culture) in games is essential for many reasons, including breaking stereotypes and building a deeper understanding of what Islam's canonical texts really mean. In fact, the word "deen" in "Deen Games" means religion, but it also means "a way of life."</p>
<h2>Why Integrate Religion Into Games?</h2>
<p>So, the core issue: why bother mixing religion with games? Certainly, this is not something people ask for (barring a very narrow definition of "game" and focusing on educational aspects, usually in the form of quizzes).</p>
<p>Some thoughts that come to mind:
- Religion, in general, is something that is often looked down upon as "backward," "violent," and not useful.
- Religion in games, is seen as almost a taboo; something people just don't do.
- In the past, some people have made thinly-veiled religious propaganda as games</p>
<p>In particular, if you look at the demographic of Muslims, it paints a similarly bleak picture:
- Muslims are often portrayed as terrorists, oppressors, and backward in media
- Games are no better - Muslims commonly appear as the antagonists in first-person shooters, supplanting Nazis</p>
<p>Knowing all this, a not-so-obvious solution becomes obvious: why not use games to counter the negativity and stereotypes around religion and Islam in particular? Games reach around the world, but can uniquely engage players interactively; can create fantsatic scenarios that don't exist outside; and can cast players in the role of those they wouldn't normally choose to be. Games can show an alternative view, and potentially build empathy for marginalized groups. (In fact, some ideologies already use games to achieve all these goals.)</p>
<p>That brings us back to Deen Games. Our mission is not to create religious propaganda or poorly-disguised quizzes. We actively work to create fun, innovative, unique, accessible games that include Muslim culture, history, and beliefs as an integral part of the game universe.</p>
<p>As one person <a href="https://twitter.com/bcscarbrough/status/1188791237089857537">aptly tweeted</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your beliefs do not bleed into your creative process on some level, they are not your beliefs. I expect a game made by Muslims to have some aspects of their beliefs even if they're not overt. Scrubbing games of every hint of a belief system to avoid offense is imo offensive.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What we can Learn from Islamic Games</h2>
<p><img alt="data cube in Ali the Android which references a verse of Qur'an" src="https://i.imgur.com/v15ki7y.png"></p>
<p>My specific interest within Islamic games is to create games that leave the player with an understanding and practical application of canonical texts of Islam through games. Because games allow us to create arbitrary fantastical scenarios and situations (fantasy and sci-fi in particular), this provides us a rich, fertile ground for creative expression and building a real understanding.</p>
<p>Creating Islamic games with visibly Muslim characters not only breaks stereotypes, but it also normalizes us in popular culture, contrary to how we're often portrayed in media.</p>
<p>It also confers an additional benefit: it allows us to easily break the common tropes/stereotypes of games. For example, a fantasy game <a href="https://deengames.itch.io/eman-quest">like Eman Quest</a> might contain slimes, bats, sentient rocks; but also jinns and other creatures/elements drawn from our Islamic theology and history.</p>
<h2>It's a Trade-Off Though</h2>
<p>Like choosing a pixel-art or low-poly aesthetic to your game, choosing to include Islamic elements comes with some down-sides. I expect the benefits to (greatly) overwhelm the downsides, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>This can break immersion. In particular, the Islamic content must be well-integrated into world lore.</li>
<li>It doesn't appeal to everyone. A rather vocal group exists decrying religion in games. Even Nintendo <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/15045-Nintendo-of-America-Used-Religious-Censorship-to-Avoid-Controver">has a history</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/losing-our-religion-5509744">removing religious elements</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActRaiser#Religious_subtext">various games</a>.</li>
<li>It takes practice to integrate religious identity and iconography and beliefs in games - especially if you don't want a very superficial integration.</li>
<li>Not every religious quote, source, message, symbol, etc. can or should be integrated into games.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this! I highly encourage you to <a href="https://twitter.com/nightblade99">drop me some comments on Twitter</a> and let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>Or, if you feel up to it, why not include a visibly Islamic element/character/outfit in your next game? I would be happy to work with you on this to define something you feel happy about including in your games.</p></li>
