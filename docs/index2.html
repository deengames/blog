<p>You can see quite a lot of changes from last month. The most obvious one is the skill shop; specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting gems collects them permanently across all runs (the three types have three different values)</li>
<li>Between runs of the game, you can upgrade your skills</li>
<li>At the skill shop, you can buy new skills, upgrade existing skills, or buy other upgrades (e.g. health) with your collected gems</li>
</ul>
<p>While feedback on this ran contrary to what I hoped, I decided to make the game more roguelike (-like?) - dying three times takes you back to the beginning of the current world. Along with permanent gems, I hope this will lead players down an experience like Hades, where they adventure for a while, die, upgrade a lot, and try different builds the next run-through.</p>
<p>I also ran a limited alpha test (around six players played it and reported their feedback, incuding recordings and streams of them playing the game). Thank you all again for testing and providing feedback, be it a little or a lot - it helped me correct the course of the game and identify some much-needed things to improve upon!</p>
<p>This month, I also completed two major blocking tasks for the game: I sat down and wrote a complete end-to-end story for the game, including designing all the major characters, and some world-building/lore. Based on this, I started modifying the first world's art to fit the theme of the first world (Brightshield masjid/mosque).</p>
<p>I have a long way to go with art, which is the focus of this month: design the worlds in detail (including obstacles and monsters), and coding whatever's necessary to make it look good. This includes polishing the first world to a gleaming sheen, something I already sunk many hours into (and expect to sink many more). Already, you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>New tiles</li>
<li>A new level border</li>
<li>A large new parallax background</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope, inshaAllah (God willing), I can complete the first world art, and some of the subsequent worlds, this month. We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>This:</p>
<iframe width="728" height="410" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kI74BXDq3PI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This is a prototype (mostly getting game systems working with placeholder or simple art) which I toiled away at for the last 30 days. Currently, it includes almost all the core systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect gems, dodge boulders, and make it to the exit without dying</li>
<li>Environmental elements to avoid, like explosive falling mines and lava pools</li>
<li>Procedurally-generated levels (five completely different level types)</li>
<li>Monsters, melee fighting, and two skills: an explosive fireball, and a stopwatch that lets you stop time for five turns.</li>
</ul>
<p>What's missing? My favourite roguelike element: the ability to spend gems to buy permanent upgrades and unlock new skills.</p>
<p>My current vision is something like a cross between Boulder Dash and Hades. You pick from an assortment of unlocked and upgraded skills, make a run, die, upgrade and pick an entirely different set, and try again. I planned 100 levels across ten different biomes, each with their own unique set of monsters and environmental dangers to deal with.</p>

          <li class="list-group-item"><p>Want to make games faster, bigger, and with better quality, while investing the same amount of time? It's possible, albeit with an unintuitive solution: a custom game engine. I'm here to tell you why you can, and should, build a custom game engine.</p>
<p>It's 2021, and lots of strong, general-purpose game engines abound: from Unreal to Godot to GameMaker to Construct, tools exist for beginner and experienced developers alike. Why bother making your own game engine?</p>
<p>It's a great learning tool, sure, but a better reason exists: you can <em>customize your game engine to your own personal style and workflow.</em></p>
<p>A great example of this is RPG Maker, which specializes in making JRPG games. Using RPG Maker, you can - very quickly, and without much coding skill - create large-scale and complex JRPGs. RPG Maker includes events for all kinds of common JRPG things (dialog, shops, inns, quest NPCs, etc.) which makes it very, very fast to build, compared to building something from scratch.</p>
<p>Even if you think this isn't a great idea, I guarantee you will learn a ton by doing this. If you're convinced, read on.</p>
<h2>Pick a Small Target</h2>
<p>You're not planning to build a general-purpose, large-scale game engines. Those are difficult, and require <a href="https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/make-a-game-engine/">lots of different skillls</a> which you may not have.</p>
<p>First, identify an existing game engine, framework, library, toolkit, etc. that you use and like. What's great about it? Importantly, what's not good about it? Where can you improve upon it, or what pain-points does it inflict on you that you wish you could work around?</p>
<p>Once you identified your starting-point, you can even build on top of an existing game engine. This way, you create a standalone library, or a thin "layer" that makes some tasks easier. It could be as simple as scene management, or as complicated as common code for a roguelike.</p>
<p>Whatever your goal, pick something small and achievable as the first step.</p>
<h2>Pick a Companion Game</h2>
<p>Now, the most important part: <strong>do not build your game engine or framework in isolation!</strong> You will end up with bloated features that are difficult to use, and code that nobody uses.  Instead, design a small standalone game that you feel really excited to build.</p>
<p>The key: build your game <em>in tandem</em> with your game engine. For example, if you need outlined text, add some code for that to your game engine, then add it to the titlescreen, options screen, or whatever location in your game that you need it.</p>
<p>This keeps your code useful, streamlined, and well-tested to begin with; it greatly increases the chances that you can ship something useful at the end of your game development cycle, whether the game ships or not.</p>
<p>Work on your game framework with that cycle: add code, test it, implement it in your game. Rinse, repeat.</p>
<h2>Use-Case</h2>
<p>If your game framework extends beyond a simple library, you should consider the user workflow carefully. How do users use your framework? Do they link a DLL, or copy/paste code into their project? Do you need to provide a template project with some starter code, or simply a spec for a JSON file?</p>
<p>Looking at this early on makes it easier for users to eventually use your game framework.</p>
<h2>Testing and Quality</h2>
<p>Testing your game framework is really important. As it grows, you will find it increasingly likely that you accidentally break things in other places and not notice. I highly recommend writing unit tests and/or integration tests for <em>every single line of code you write.</em> This makes it very easy to make changes: you simply run the tests, and they identify anything broken you need to fix.</p>
<h2>A War Story: Oneons and Puffin</h2>
<p>I applied this process to a number of game frameworks over the years (mostly abandonware). One of them, <a href="https://github.com/nightblade9/puffin-v1">Puffin</a>, actually shipped to production (I finished it and launched the game and the framework). It didn't meet my long-term needs, but it worked well enough.</p>
<p>Here's a quick summary of how that came to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target:</strong> I really like Godot. One thing that frequently bugs me is the lack of free support for exporting your game for the Nintendo Switch. I'm also not a big fan of GDscript, the internal, Python-like scripting language.</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> I decided to build something similar to Godot - a visual IDE - albeit in C#. I chose MonoGame as my base, since I've used it before, and since it has excellent free support for porting to the Switch</li>
<li><strong>Small Target:</strong> For the first version of Puffin, I decided to leverage my experience with CraftyJS and build a small, easy-to-use fluent API. I based it on Entity-Component System architecture. (This isn't a good fit for Godot-like games, which use nested nodes.)</li>
<li><strong>Start Small:</strong> I build the absolute minimum code to get started: a base entity class, and some components for rendering sprites and text. That's it.  I decided I would limit myself to no IDE or UI controls, as those require a lot of additional effort to build.</li>
<li><strong>Companion Game:</strong> I started immediately on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342600/Oneons_Prisoners/">Oneons</a>, my companion game: a tiny broughlike dungeon-crawler with 12 floors of mayhem, monsters with powers, and tactical combat. I shipped the first version of Oneons, with Puffin, in a month for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/persistent-roguelike-jam/">Persistent Game Jam</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Unit testing:</strong> Most of the Puffin code is unit-tested, and every commit builds and runs the test in Jenkins. This helped me notice when I accidentally broke things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, Puffin didn't meet my needs; in particular, the choice of an ECS architecture didn't mesh well with Godot-style nested scenes and subscenes.</p>
<p>I may revisit Puffin in the future, and I certainly learned a lot about development through this experience. I hope you, too, will find the time and effort to build something, big or small, to help you build games you like faster and better than whatever you're using today.</p></li>

<p>Introducing Crystal Caverns, a match-3/roguelike hybrid with persistent upgrades. In the last two months, I took this game from a rough prototype to what you see in the video. At present, the game includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bare-bones battle system: players and monsters take turns attacking.</li>
<li>A basic match-3 game with collapse mechanics, albeit you can swap any two tiles</li>
<li>Victory and defeat</li>
<li>Persistent currency (crystal shards) which you retain across battles</li>
</ul>
<p>Battles appear bare-bones at the moment, but include some depth: 
- Players can attack, critical-strike, boost defense, poison enemies, drain, and heal.
- Monster attacks affect the board in various ways (currently, they just eat random tiles).</p>
<p>That includes enough of the core game to improve upon.</p>
<p>Next month, I plan to turn my attention more towards the roguelike side of the game: generating dungeons with monsters, finding treasure (including persistent treasure), and balancing exploration with progression.</p></li>

<p>Hello! Long-time readers of this blog may notice a couple of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new, mobile-responsive theme</li>
<li>A complete restructuring of content</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to redo the blog to make it mobile-friendly, and to hange the content - instead of game development notes and game design articles, instead, I plan to focus on my games.</p>
<p>What can you expect going forward? Weekly posts show-casing the best of whatever current project I'm working on.</p>
<p>Old articles will stay available for a while.</p></li>
