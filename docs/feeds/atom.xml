&lt;p&gt;I released Gem Worlds v1.1.0 today (both the full game and the demo). This patch includes a few important changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Full game only) Fixes Steam achievements not triggering.

&lt;li&gt;I revamped the options menu completely; it now includes sections, and more importantly, is fully usable by keyboard and gamepad (with some minor visual bugs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug where, in a rare case in World 3, the bottom-right corner of the map appears dark gray.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamepad support is still a work-in-progress, and I intend to get back to it next month (after my break from game development).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category><category term="Gem Worlds"></category></entry><entry><title>Gem Worlds v1.0.1 Releases January 16, 2023</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2023/gem-worlds-v101-releases-january-16-2023.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2023-01-13:/blog/2023/gem-worlds-v101-releases-january-16-2023.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of v1.0.1 banner" src="https://i.imgur.com/9k4aRHJ.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, adding gamepad (and full keyboard) support took a lot longer than anticipated. While I made major strides in updating and modernizing the main menu, I didn't fully finish the changes, and it's buggy enough that I'm going to hold off on releasing an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan for the next release, v1.1.0, still includes full gamepad, keyboard, and mouse support for the entire game. I'm quite burned out from working on the game for 18 months, but I'll see how much farther I can go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your support, and see you at release!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category><category term="Gem Worlds"></category></entry><entry><title>Gem Worlds v1.1.0 Roadmap</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2022/gem-worlds-v110-roadmap.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-12-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2022-12-25:/blog/2022/gem-worlds-v110-roadmap.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image of a game controller" src="https://i.imgur.com/SgN7JFx.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned last week, Gem Worlds (the full game) will release on January 16th. Given that I have a couple of weeks, I already started on the next release - v1.1.0. Since I have a couple of users playing the demo on Steam Deck, it makes sense to include Steam Deck support with the next release. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An option on the main menu to quit to the title screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gamepad support throughout the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A better explanation of why gems turn black and white&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of indication that boulders are going to fall next turn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next demo release and first full release is going out on January 16th, and whatever features are done, will ship at that time (probably partial gamepad support). Whatever isn't done, will ship in a subsequent release.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category><category term="Gem Worlds"></category></entry><entry><title>Gem Worlds v1.0.1 Demo Released</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2022/gem-worlds-v101-demo-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2022-12-18:/blog/2022/gem-worlds-v101-demo-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of v1.0.1 banner" src="https://i.imgur.com/60E8un1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v1.0.1 of the demo ships today. This build primarily includes bug-fixes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a rare case where you spawn under a lock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a rare case where boulders slide over a one-tile gap&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've fixed all the bugs I know about (except one). Once that's done, if I get a clean run through the game without any bugs, the game goes out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, check out this rare bug I fixed, where a Bomb Bot directly following another Bomb Bot can end up walking on top of a time bomb, if the first bot drops it.&lt;/p&gt;

November ended up being bug-fixing month, and I found a couple of content things that need to be replaced (icicles and beehives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before launching any game, I play through it over and over, until I can go from start to finish without seeing any bugs. For Gem Worlds, that’s a little trickier, since the game takes around two hours to complete (longest game I’ve made yet). I’ve reached the fifth and final world, and tested all the skills, so things are looking pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope and pray that I can still ship the game this year, but it’s looking close. In terms of gameplay, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nightblade99/status/1596912437147865090"&gt;here’s a quick look&lt;/a&gt; (via Twitter) at some UI changes in terms of how skill selection looks (World 4):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of skill selection with a green button" src="https://i.imgur.com/DSww8NF.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, some non-Gem-Worlds related things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I signed up for the GitHub Game Off 2022 jam, but our project ended up falling through (mostly design/architecture discussions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am still very, very interested in making a JRPG next, albeit I definitely cannot handle the scope of it on my own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My next project might very well be a classic dungeon crawler (roguelike), but I will know more closer to the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you haven’t already, please wishlist and follow the game on Steam, it helps with visibility on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858760?utm_source=revue&amp;amp;utm_campaign=release"&gt;the Steam store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category><category term="Gem Worlds"></category></entry><entry><title>Gem Worlds v1.0 Demo Released</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2022/gem-worlds-v10-demo-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2022-11-11:/blog/2022/gem-worlds-v10-demo-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of v1.0 banner" src="https://i.imgur.com/YYH3DyM.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;v1.0 ships today, and includes a major change in how skills work. Instead of saving up gems across multiple levels and buying skills from the shop, you now learn a new skill every other level. You get to pick between upgrading two previously learned skills, or learning one new skill. You also get to change your equipped skills. I hope this will encourage more experimentation with skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version also includes several smaller changes;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can choose between multiple save slots. All your existing progress is placed in the first slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have unlimited lives and no longer can get game over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each world generates only two types of levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed background music and options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options scroll vertically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Accessibility) you can disable the gradient shader for tiles, which makes it much easier to see what's going on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release also includes a slew of bug fixes. The most important ones are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a soft lock when you push a boulder into the exit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a soft lock when you push a mine into an explosion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressing space rapidly while next to a monster no longer makes other monsters move erratically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving non-stop no longer causes some boulders to defy gravity and dance up and down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clicking on skill buttons correctly activates skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing a tipped boulder upward into a teleporter no longer causes it to dance up and down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed janky monster movement if you hit a monster and immediately move&lt;/li&gt;

Here we are, after 15 months of evenings and weekends, with the end in sight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished all the content for Gem Worlds as of a few minutes ago; all that remains is to play the game through (over and over and over) and find/fix any bugs that show up. And there are probably a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t do release dates, but if I did, I would guess that the game will ship sometime in November. Here’s the plan for the next little while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play through the demo, find bugs, fix bugs, repeat. Once I can’t find any more bugs, ship the demo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play through the full game, find bugs, fix bugs, repeat. Once I can’t find any more bugs, release it to Steam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the coming days after release, fix and patch any critical bugs that inevitably appear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the days turn to weeks, add some planned features (Steam cloud save, and a bunch of accessibility features).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above all, monitor the player (that’s you) feedback, and adjust the game accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope the game takes off and I get genuine feedback on how to shape it. I plan to support it for at least a couple of months, until I figure out my next project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, here’s a (spoiler-free) screenshot of something end-game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you tried the game before and have the inclination and time to try it again, please do, and let me know what you think of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category><category term="Gem Worlds"></category></entry><entry><title>Gem Worlds Terrain Update</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2022/gem-worlds-terrain-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2022-07-13:/blog/2022/gem-worlds-terrain-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="demo screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/nRbaVgu.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello! I made lots of changes to Gem Worlds over the last couple of months, based on player feedback that the game could use more interesting interactions between things in-world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on that, I added a few terrain types to the game; they generate in each world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teleporters: previously existed …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="demo screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/nRbaVgu.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello! I made lots of changes to Gem Worlds over the last couple of months, based on player feedback that the game could use more interesting interactions between things in-world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on that, I added a few terrain types to the game; they generate in each world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teleporters: previously existed, but now exist in every world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light Stars: they move back and forth, even through dirt tiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receeding blocks traps: once you step on them, they pop up into walls for a few turns, then reset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added, then scrapped, a couple of terrain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pipes, which move you from one spot to another (inspired by Supaplex's pipes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conveyor belts, which constantly move everything on them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conveyor belts added a lot of interesting dynamics to the game. Unfortunately, they also contributed a disproportionately huge amount of bugs. In the end, I scrapped them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, they also exposed a huge performance issue, where moving caused a drop of ~130ms (roughly ten frames). Fixing this required ripping out and rewriting the main collision-detection system, which resulted in an explosion of bugs, and took way too many weeks to fix. Alhamdulillah, those are all fixed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added (again based on played feedback) keys and locks! In every 5th and 10th level of each world, the exit appears from the start, but lock blocks surround it; you need to find one (or three) keys to unlock them and exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to shipping a new v0.5.0 demo soon inshaAllah, and getting (and integrating) more feedback and features into the game. When that ships, I would really appreciate it if you could give it a quick play-through, and let me know your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category><category term="Gem Worlds"></category></entry><entry><title>Gem Worlds Demo, MacOS Support</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2022/gem-worlds-demo-macos-support.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2022-05-12:/blog/2022/gem-worlds-demo-macos-support.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="demo screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/q61MvdI.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not working much on Gem Worlds during Ramadan, I'm very happy to announce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gem Worlds participated in the Steam &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/going_rogue"&gt;Going Rogue&lt;/a&gt; festival. This resulted in a huge visibility boost (around 50k visits in a week).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of that, I launched the Gem Worlds demo. While the fesitval is …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="demo screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/q61MvdI.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gem Worlds participated in the Steam &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/going_rogue"&gt;Going Rogue&lt;/a&gt; festival. This resulted in a huge visibility boost (around 50k visits in a week).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of that, I launched the Gem Worlds demo. While the fesitval is over, you can still play the demo &lt;a href="https://s.team/a/1858760"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally have access to Mac hardware to develop and test my games. Accordingly, I launched the Mac version of the Gem Worlds demo, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on feedback from a couple of players, I changed a number of things in the game; most notably:
- I added keyboard bindings and fixed tooltips for all skills and items
- You can change sklils at any time, by quitting to the skill shop (you resume back from the same level afterward).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this resulted in lots of people looking at Gem Worlds, it resulted in a mere ~30-ish downloads.  This confirms one of my hunches from a few months back: the core game itself isn't that interesting or captivating. Based on the feedback I received from a couple of players, despite being designed as "play, die, retry with different skills," the replayability and interest in continuing through the game is minimal or zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dramatically hurt my motivation to work on the game. It's the biggest game I've ever made (by at least 50%). Regardless, my plan is to inshaAllah continue slogging through the leftover work to get the game out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I may not run a beta version, either; that requires at least a significant amount of players (new and recurring), which I didn't get access to. I'll provide updates on that as development continues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category><category term="Gem Worlds"></category></entry><entry><title>Gem Worlds: March Update</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2022/gem-worlds-march-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-25T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-03-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2022-03-25:/blog/2022/gem-worlds-march-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey all, just wanted to drop a quick note and let you know that Gem Worlds is pretty much content-complete.

You can play the game from start to finish, and aside from some bugs and missing polish, the game is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next couple of months up to the release, the plan is to add missing polish (like sound design, story events, and an ending) and find/fix bugs. There won't be much to show, but it's critical work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, I am also planning to launch a demo of Gem Worlds. The demo will remain up-to-date with the rest of the game (it won't lag behind in terms of features or fixes), and I hope many of you will play it and pass along your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the roadmap for the next few months (other than Ramadan, which is most of April and won't include much/any gamedev) looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add sound design, story events, options, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch the game demo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add polish and fix bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat until the game is ready for beta testing&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a crazy two months since I wrote the last blog post. In the last post, I talked about the 21 skills and ten worlds. Since then, I &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858760?utm_source=blog"&gt;launched the game on Steam&lt;/a&gt;.

Since then, I &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858760?utm_source=blog"&gt;launched the game on Steam&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the first month worth of metrics, it looks like the game will be a flop. (Steam gamers tend to like deep games, tend to hate puzzle games, and it looks like the roguelike aspects of this game aren't enough to lift it out of the puzzle genre.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of dropping the project, I decided to cut scope, and cut the number of worlds in half, from ten to five. This will save me anything from weeks to months of development, and will allow me to shine a light on other, much-needed areas - such as audio production. Plus, if players enjoy the game, I can always add more worlds and skills later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the completion of the fourth of five worlds. Here's a list of some of the interesting enemies you encounter in the third and fourth world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ice-mimic in the ice world. It looks like an ice cube, and spawns breakable ice walls as it walks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bee-hive in the tree world; it spawns cute bees, which (sadly) can be killed, but eventually respawn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A creature that waits for you to approach, and once you do, relentlessly stalks you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Troublesome teleporting tree pixies that hit you and teleport away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see (if you look carefully) two ice mimics here: &lt;img alt="ice mimimcs in the ice world" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJvTkb2XEAAXkjZ?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a brief preview of the fifth and final (space / spaceship) world, featuring laser fields that oscillate on and off, and damage anything inside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="laser field" src="https://i.imgur.com/z56vkiD.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From October, I worked on designing and drawing skills for Gem Worlds. I think of the game as something like a cross between Boudler Dash and Hades: you dodge boulders, collect gems of different types, battle enemies, avoid enviornment-specific obstacles, and eventually escape through the portal.

&lt;p&gt;From October, I worked on designing and drawing skills for Gem Worlds. I think of the game as something like a cross between Boudler Dash and Hades: you dodge boulders, collect gems of different types, battle enemies, avoid enviornment-specific obstacles, and eventually escape through the portal. At the same time, you can pick from 21 different skills - a mix of active and passive - and enemies can use skills, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a game designer, I hope the array of different skills will allow users to not only custom-pick the skills that best fit their personality and play-style, but also control the difficulty. In my previous game, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342600"&gt;Oneons&lt;/a&gt;, which I designed to be brutally hard, I added an optional heal skill in response to players complaining the game was too difficult; I hope that approach can work here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skills break down into two categories: active, and passive. Active skills require you to use them, and come in two variations: cooldown based (e.g. usable every 4 turns), and quantity based (e.g. only 4 uses per level). These include elemental attacks like fireball (area damage), freeze (stop monsters for a few turns) to time-bombs that explode after a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passive skills always take effect, all the time. These vary a great deal, ranging from the mundane Fireproof skill (which makes you invincible to explosions) to the game-changing Wall Walker skill (that lets you walk through walls) or the More Gems skill, which greatly increases the number of gems in a level (thus dropping the difficulty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I started working on the second (or third, not sure yet) world - a desert-themed world. I couldn't draw art good enough for it to be a "crystal desert," but I hope the monster art will bring that out. The video only shows the tiles and background; here are some monsters in various stages of design, from concept to final sprite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="six desert and/or crystal monsters" src="https://i.imgur.com/J4Qij6A.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, 21 skills, which is a lot. After the first world, which introduces the game mechanics to the player, monsters will start including their own skills - ranging from passive ones (like being explosion-proof or teleporting away if hit) to active ones that affect the player and environment in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category><category term="Gem Worlds"></category></entry><entry><title>Gem Worlds: November 2021</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2021/gem-worlds-november-2021.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2021-11-13:/blog/2021/gem-worlds-november-2021.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello!

&lt;p&gt;As I alluded to last …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello! I took a month off from game development to focus on some personal, real-life things. Now that it's mostly settled, I'm back full-force into game development. I think it's fair to say, I'm working harder on this game than any I made so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I alluded to last week, I spent a great deal of time reworking the game art. Here's a screenshot showing how the game looks now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/FffzxK2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, you can see the main character changed, as well as all the monsters. They now follow the world theme, which is drawn partially from the over-arching game story (different worlds) - hence the finalized game name, "Gem Worlds."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, I started in earnest on the skill system. You can see how it look so far: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="728" height="410" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mASgo2hkQKs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the playable alpha/prototype from earlier this year, players could purchase skills between runs, using (permanent) gems earned each run. You can upgrade skills, and customize your experience - everything from more health to stronger fireballs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the earlier versions, in the final game, you can only select a few skills for each run. This is to encourage players to try out different skill combinations, find synergies, upgrade the ones they like, and hopefully also customize your difficulty. You can - for example - upgrade fireballs to their max, and use them to snipe enemies from afar; or you can upgrade your health a lot, and recklessly charge into danger. (There's also an invincibility option, for anyone who wants to just see the story or complete the game more easily.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned skills include a combination of innate abilities, as well as technological tools. There are a lot of ways in which they can interact with each other, and with the world. I hope that will lead to more interesting, fun, surprising experiences, but that also means a lot more testing to make sure the game ships bug-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That pretty much wraps it up for this month.

&lt;p&gt;You can see quite a lot of changes from last month. The most obvious one is the skill shop; specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Between …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's me completing a single level in a new run of the gem roguelike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collecting gems collects them permanently across all runs (the three types have three different values)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between runs of the game, you can upgrade your skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the skill shop, you can buy new skills, upgrade existing skills, or buy other upgrades (e.g. health) with your collected gems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While feedback on this ran contrary to what I hoped, I decided to make the game more roguelike (-like?) - dying three times takes you back to the beginning of the current world. Along with permanent gems, I hope this will lead players down an experience like Hades, where they adventure for a while, die, upgrade a lot, and try different builds the next run-through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also ran a limited alpha test (around six players played it and reported their feedback, incuding recordings and streams of them playing the game). Thank you all again for testing and providing feedback, be it a little or a lot - it helped me correct the course of the game and identify some much-needed things to improve upon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, I also completed two major blocking tasks for the game: I sat down and wrote a complete end-to-end story for the game, including designing all the major characters, and some world-building/lore. Based on this, I started modifying the first world's art to fit the theme of the first world (Brightshield masjid/mosque).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a long way to go with art, which is the focus of this month: design the worlds in detail (including obstacles and monsters), and coding whatever's necessary to make it look good. This includes polishing the first world to a gleaming sheen, something I already sunk many hours into (and expect to sink many more). Already, you can see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New tiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new level border&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large new parallax background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope, inshaAllah (God willing), I can complete the first world art, and some of the subsequent worlds, this month. We'll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a prototype (mostly getting game systems working with placeholder or simple art) which I toiled away at for the last 30 days. Currently, it includes almost all the core systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect gems, dodge boulders, and make it to the exit without dying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental elements to avoid, like explosive falling mines and lava pools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procedurally-generated levels (five completely different level types)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monsters, melee fighting, and two skills: an explosive fireball, and a stopwatch that lets you stop time for five turns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's missing? My favourite roguelike element: the ability to spend gems to buy permanent upgrades and unlock new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current vision is something like a cross between Boulder Dash and Hades. You pick from an assortment of unlocked and upgraded skills, make a run, die, upgrade and pick an entirely different set, and try again. I planned 100 levels across ten different biomes, each with their own unique set of monsters and environmental dangers to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bare-bones battle system: players and monsters take turns attacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A basic match-3 game with collapse mechanics, albeit you can swap any two tiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Victory and defeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent currency (crystal shards) which you retain across battles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battles appear bare-bones at the moment, but include some depth: 
- Players can attack, critical-strike, boost defense, poison enemies, drain, and heal.
- Monster attacks affect the board in various ways (currently, they just eat random tiles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes enough of the core game to improve upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month, I plan to turn my attention more towards the roguelike side of the game: generating dungeons with monsters, finding treasure (including persistent treasure), and balancing exploration with progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category><category term="Crystal Caverns"></category></entry><entry><title>Blog Reboot</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2021/blog-reboot.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-03-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2021-03-18:/blog/2021/blog-reboot.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/7tmqvLl.jpeg" alt="sign that says: changes ahead" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently engaged in a conversation with someone about religion and games; specifically, about me showing, explaining, and playing the audio of verses of the Qur'an in my games.

&lt;p&gt;I recently engaged in a conversation with someone about religion and games; specifically, about me showing, explaining, and playing the audio of verses of the Qur'an in my games. This discussion lead me to think about, question, evaluate, and eventually understand (at a deeper level) why I do this, and why I included that section in that game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize: I think the use of religion (specifically, elements of Islam and Muslim culture) in games is essential for many reasons, including breaking stereotypes and building a deeper understanding of what Islam's canonical texts really mean. In fact, the word "deen" in "Deen Games" means religion, but it also means "a way of life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Integrate Religion Into Games?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the core issue: why bother mixing religion with games? Certainly, this is not something people ask for (barring a very narrow definition of "game" and focusing on educational aspects, usually in the form of quizzes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts that come to mind:
- Religion, in general, is something that is often looked down upon as "backward," "violent," and not useful.
- Religion in games, is seen as almost a taboo; something people just don't do.
- In the past, some people have made thinly-veiled religious propaganda as games&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, if you look at the demographic of Muslims, it paints a similarly bleak picture:
- Muslims are often portrayed as terrorists, oppressors, and backward in media
- Games are no better - Muslims commonly appear as the antagonists in first-person shooters, supplanting Nazis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing all this, a not-so-obvious solution becomes obvious: why not use games to counter the negativity and stereotypes around religion and Islam in particular? Games reach around the world, but can uniquely engage players interactively; can create fantsatic scenarios that don't exist outside; and can cast players in the role of those they wouldn't normally choose to be. Games can show an alternative view, and potentially build empathy for marginalized groups. (In fact, some ideologies already use games to achieve all these goals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us back to Deen Games. Our mission is not to create religious propaganda or poorly-disguised quizzes. We actively work to create fun, innovative, unique, accessible games that include Muslim culture, history, and beliefs as an integral part of the game universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one person &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bcscarbrough/status/1188791237089857537"&gt;aptly tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your beliefs do not bleed into your creative process on some level, they are not your beliefs. I expect a game made by Muslims to have some aspects of their beliefs even if they're not overt. Scrubbing games of every hint of a belief system to avoid offense is imo offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we can Learn from Islamic Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="data cube in Ali the Android which references a verse of Qur'an" src="https://i.imgur.com/v15ki7y.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My specific interest within Islamic games is to create games that leave the player with an understanding and practical application of canonical texts of Islam through games. Because games allow us to create arbitrary fantastical scenarios and situations (fantasy and sci-fi in particular), this provides us a rich, fertile ground for creative expression and building a real understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating Islamic games with visibly Muslim characters not only breaks stereotypes, but it also normalizes us in popular culture, contrary to how we're often portrayed in media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also confers an additional benefit: it allows us to easily break the common tropes/stereotypes of games. For example, a fantasy game &lt;a href="https://deengames.itch.io/eman-quest"&gt;like Eman Quest&lt;/a&gt; might contain slimes, bats, sentient rocks; but also jinns and other creatures/elements drawn from our Islamic theology and history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's a Trade-Off Though&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like choosing a pixel-art or low-poly aesthetic to your game, choosing to include Islamic elements comes with some down-sides. I expect the benefits to (greatly) overwhelm the downsides, which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can break immersion. In particular, the Islamic content must be well-integrated into world lore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't appeal to everyone. A rather vocal group exists decrying religion in games. Even Nintendo &lt;a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/15045-Nintendo-of-America-Used-Religious-Censorship-to-Avoid-Controver"&gt;has a history&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/losing-our-religion-5509744"&gt;removing religious elements&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActRaiser#Religious_subtext"&gt;various games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes practice to integrate religious identity and iconography and beliefs in games - especially if you don't want a very superficial integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not every religious quote, source, message, symbol, etc. can or should be integrated into games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read this! I highly encourage you to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nightblade99"&gt;drop me some comments on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and let me know your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, if you feel up to it, why not include a visibly Islamic element/character/outfit in your next game? I would be happy to work with you on this to define something you feel happy about including in your games.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Game Development"></category></entry><entry><title>Eman Quest Retrospective</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2019/eman-quest-retrospective.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2019-08-22:/blog/2019/eman-quest-retrospective.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/rpSFnxr.png" alt="screenshot of the protagonist in a cave map" width="750" height="450" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the rather large retrospective on &lt;a href="https://deengames.itch.io/eman-quest"&gt;Eman Quest&lt;/a&gt;. Eman Quest, if you haven't heard about it, is a "procedurally-generated mini-RPG with memory mechanics." You can try the full game, for free, on Itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This retrospective covers two parts: first, the overall idea (what did I plan to achieve? What did I actually achieve? Reflections), and the key lessons learned (mostly specific to Godot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Overall Idea: A Procedurally-Generated RPG&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like procedural content generation (in general), although it's deceptively difficult to implement correctly (corner cases really get you). I always wanted to make a "procedurally-generated Chrono Trigger-like RPG," although that's a huge undertaking; Eman Quest was the first step: creating a small, "lightweight" or "mini" RPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, exactly, did I include in Eman Quest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fixed story about life, faith, and family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven different areas; these are three geographies (forest, cave, and dungeon) each with multiple biomes (frost forest, death forest, desert dungeon, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A unique world: each time you play a new game, it picks three out of seven biomes, and generates the required maps for each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique enemies, two per area, statically-generated and balanced with careful trade-offs (eg. glass cannon, tank), and a unique boss per biome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procedurally-generated equipment (weapons, armour), including their stats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A battle system that relies on not puzzle/thinking or skills/reflexes, but memory: remember the selected tiles, pick them to get action points, chain them to get tech points, and then use them for your turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two fixed skills in battle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A progression system with experience, levels, and stats points you can distribute to your liking (respeccing is free).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/2bx1y6M.gif" alt="one round of battle" width="750" height="450" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't include many things in Eman Quest; specifically, I analyzed Bastion, how they cut corners to cut down on the amount of content they needed to complete the game, and applied it to my game. Specificially:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I scrapped procedural story-, world-, event-, and character-creation, and wrote a fixed story instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I scrapped the world map, because it adds little or no value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't incude any NPCs or shops, because those require a lot of art/coding. (You always find better equipment in chests than what you're using.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cut a few things in content: avatars, some biome variants (crystal caves), variant bosses, and unique final-boss skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What Went Well&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the result, and thankful that I could finish this project, although it doesn't come quite close to my initial vision (due to scope cuts and resource/time constraints).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I really like about Eman Quest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It "feels" like a procedurally-generated RPG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's balanced (monsters seem quite distinct/different to fight) even though it's on the easy side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quite a few people completed the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The memory mechanics received some compliments (more on the design below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I shipped. Especially considering I tend to abandon long-running projects, this is especially important to me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I polished the game considerably, including audio (background and sound-effects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I received some fan-art, and several questions about my protagonist; which prompted me to create an elaborate background, and a character representing many minorities: a strong woman, a Muslim, and an African&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I represented Muslims and Islam positively, and communicated one of our values (good treatment of parents)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned a lot about game accessibility, and added a few accessibility options into my game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, you can see the fan-art of the protagonist, Aisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my first full Godot project, I'm not really proud of the code quality; as I joked on &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/frKXYtG"&gt;my Discord server&lt;/a&gt;, code quality decreases as you get closer to production!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/LeKMWbk.jpg" width="600" height="570" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Memory Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="memory mechanics screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/xOOetlV.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the technical challenge of creating a procedural RPG, I challenged myself to create a fun battle mechanic based on memory instead of reflexes or puzzles.  I also received lots of good feedback about this from users, who praised the memory mechanic as interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core mechanic works simply: a 5x5 grid appears, some squares highlight for a fractional second, and then disappear. You need to click on those highlighted tiles to accumulate "action points," which you can use for different actions (attack costs 2, critical costs 3, and defend/heal costs 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In initial prototypes, I experimented with requiring players to pick both energy (action poinst) and actions they wanted to play. This proved to be quite "stressful," because you have a fractional second to look for both required energy tiles and action tiles; midway through development, I streamlined it into what it is now.  I also tried several variations (incluiding a "simon says" type mini-game and a stream of "which of these items did you never see before"), both of which didn't seem fun enough to include in the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found that battles become somewhat rote and mechanical/deterministic after a while: you pick the five specified tiles, then pick crit, attack, and repeat, healing as necessary.  To change it up, and to reward skillful play, I added techniques/skills and technical points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players who pick three or more tiles correctly in a row (with no mistakes) acquire tech points. If you select all five tiles correctly, you get a total of three tech points. You can save these up and use either five or seven for stun/vampire skills respectively. This adds an element of strategy and non-determinism.  Tech poinst also persist across battles, adding another dimension of planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What Didn't Go Well + Key Insights&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially planned one month to complete the project; it ended up taking around nine months. Why? Many reasons, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I realized early on that different forests just didn't cut it, and needed both variation (styles of forests) and map types (cave, dungeon, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating art was not my strong-suite, and I needed three distinct tilesets, each with two unique variations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding, drawing and animating 14 monsters, and their walk cycles, took a lot of effort; even though I found many of the base sprites and received lots of help on the art side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added the story about five months in, and required implementing an entire message dialog system, key-item system, final-game events, and lots of unexpected things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical struggles with, and crashes in, Godot (more on that below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into several difficulties along the way.  These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning Godot's API, which seemed quite foreign to me (anything is a scene and can contain sub-scenes). Also, Godot is quite a wide framework, and it takes time to discover/learn/use things (like UI components).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning about Godot's automatic garbage-collection (&lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;queue_free&lt;/code&gt;) and how they destroy all objects when changing scenes. This caused me to rewrite my early version to completely separate data about maps (tiles, treasure, etc.) from the visual presentation of those, which got GCed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote garbage, prototype-quality code throughout. This lead to numerous bugs (some difficult to diagnose and fix), and a cycle of "fix something but break something else" late in development. You can see tweets with some bugs, including a few hilarious ones, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%40nightblade99 %23EmanQuest %23Bugs"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't write any unit or integration tests. This meant I could break things without noticing for days/weeks. I remedied this quite late in development by using GUT (Godot Unit Testing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of CI. Unlike other, C#-based projects, I couldn't get Travis to run my tests; so if I forgot to run tests, broken things stay unnoticed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final game crashed a lot, which caused a lot of stress and resulted in a lot of lessons; so I wrote a section just on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close to the end of development, I lost my GPU on my main development machine, and my main Windows installed contained drivers that didn't run with Godot 3.0.6. I ended up switching to Linux (which included up-to-date drivers), but lost of a lot of time; I also upgraded Godot to 3.1.1, which initially showed a problem with cave maps running at 2-3FPS, but works fine on Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serialization for saving games. As &lt;a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/io/saving_games.html"&gt;the Godot docs on saving games&lt;/a&gt; suggests, you need to &lt;em&gt;manually&lt;/em&gt; serialize all your (nested, hierarchial) data structures into JSON. This requires a lot of boilerplate, and it's very tedious (you may miss a field and not realize unless you test thoroughly).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Game Crashed on Release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I released the game, it crashed. A lot. This undoubtedly resulted in a terrible first-impression, although I received several supportive comments such as "it crashed once and then I reloaded and it was fine" or "it keeps crashing after battles but I completed the game."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did it crash, why didn't I notice, and how did I fix the crashes?  Well, I'm glad you asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Godot runs the game in the editor, somewhat differently from when you export the final platform-specific release. This includes differences such as caring about case-sensitivity (which the Editor doesn't, on Windows), and - critically - crashing when you do Bad Things (like waiting for an event and disposing the scene before it comes back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always tested Eman Quest from within the editor, so I never noticed (or cared to notice?) the errors. The game also crashed on Linux and (troublingly) MacOS (which I don't have hardware to test with), but not on Windows, so I failed to catch it in my pre-release testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I upgraded Godot from 3.0.6 to 3.1.1 (someone commented that it didn't work with their graphics card, and 3.1.1 works with OpenGLES 3.1 and earlier), and the crashes disappeared.  I also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tested on Linux (after switching to Linux) and found I could reproduce, and fix, one crash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed sporadically-appearing errors that Godot printed out, which fixed at least one crash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received great offers of help from people on Twitter, specifically running MacOS, who found workflows in-game that reproduced the crash, and verified after I fixed them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Action Items&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned several key lessons out of this. Learning about Godot itself proved invaluable; beyond that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write clean code.&lt;/strong&gt; (Clean meaning, as good as you can make it.) This results in less bugs and less painful troubleshooting later on when things turn bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export and test your project often.&lt;/strong&gt; This catches bugs, crashes, and all kinds of badness that you don't want players to find first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix all runtime errors, and any errors/warnings Godot generates.&lt;/strong&gt; These often foreshadow crashes when the game runs (sometimes, only on select platforms - Windows seems fairly resilient)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unit test everything.&lt;/strong&gt; Unit testing is cheap, runs quickly, and pays for itself in spades; you can quickly catch issues without manually retesting everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up a continuous integration pipeline to run your tests.&lt;/strong&gt; With GitHub and Travis, you can check in code, and get an email whenever you broke some tests (but didn't notice by running them manually). That can be invaluable to avoid breaking things that work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Godot community is awesome.&lt;/strong&gt; Ask on Discord, open a GitHub issue, post a tweet - there are experienced developers who will get back to you, promptly, with solid solutions. Just be careful what you ask for! (I upgraded to Godot 3.1.1  and needed to redo all my UI to fix a tiny bug with one slider.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always update to the latest version of Godot.&lt;/strong&gt; It really works better, and often clears up hard-to-fix bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make friends on Twitter.&lt;/strong&gt; You never know who will like, follow, comment, download your game, and - critically - help often comes from those who we least expect it from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to personally thank everyone who helped me with the project - you know who you are. Without your help, coaching, support, and mentorship, I would never actually finished the game.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Retrospective"></category><category term="Godot"></category></entry><entry><title>A Month in Review: July 2018</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2018/a-month-in-review-july-2018.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-08-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2018-08-03:/blog/2018/a-month-in-review-july-2018.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;July brought a lot of challenges. @Chemical_Ink's internet went down for several days.

I ran into a very busy work schedule. All of this meant less time for Abu Hamid X; but walhamdulillah, we still managed to ship a lot of changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, we decided to drop the adventure/open-world concept and stick to what we prototyped and proved as fun: the arena combat challenge. This introduced a lot of story/worldbuilding challenges, but we managed to work something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/460638759470366733/475123856483287052/ahx-betaboosters-july2018.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Half-hidden assassins who lunge and stab from out-of-sight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lava eruptions that mean instant death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proximity mines that explode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumping enemies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spike traps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every prototype aims to answer a question. This prototype answers the question: "can a jetpack-toting samurai with a gun, flying around and killing hordes of enemies and giants, be a fun gaming experience?" We believe the answer is "yes!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the core gameplay elements in the screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running around, jumping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flying with a jetpack with limited fuel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacking enemies with a sword&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shooting with a gun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fighting giant, semi-invincible monsters (the juggling is a physics bug)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we gather some feedback, we can plan the next phase and start on the actual game: planning, coding, art, sound, and more.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/B3tp3dy.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in the early stages of prototyping, so I can't share too many details right now (as things are scarce). Our major Islamic/educational goal for this project is to &lt;em&gt;show world events through an Islamic lens.&lt;/em&gt; How that will play out, we will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as prototyping, we have our basic jetpack/combat system in place. You can fly around the screen and strike enemies, and they can harm you (sort of).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of work left to be done in prototyping, but we're fairly optimistic that this will result in a fun core game loop with lots of interesting side gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also breaking from game development for a couple of weeks, as we're now entering the last half of Ramadan. You can expect game development to resume its regular schedule in mid-to-late-June.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category></entry><entry><title>Talha's Migration, Week 6-7</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2017/talhas-migration-week-6-7.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2017-08-18:/blog/2017/talhas-migration-week-6-7.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/Xw5LHIs.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xw5LHIs.gif" width="672" height="378" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last couple of weeks mostly entailed playtesting and game-balancing tweaks. As a result, we made a few visible changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There's a new "Sense of Smell"  upgrade that materializes as a white arrow, and shows you where the next creature will appear. In the GIF above, it predicts a shark, then a squid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Krill now appear in abundance, but net you only one food per catch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shrank swimming crabs slightly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see these changes in the GIF above. We plan to continue playtesting and tweaking in the next weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also nerfed the images back to coloured blocks, because that makes it easier to focus on gameplay rather than asthetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category><category term="Talha's Migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Talha's Migration, Week 5</title><link href="https://www.deengames.com/blog/2017/talhas-migration-week-5.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>nightblade</name></author><id>tag:www.deengames.com,2017-08-04:/blog/2017/talhas-migration-week-5.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/SfuJvW7.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/SfuJvW7.gif" width="672" height="378" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also nailed down the final resolution at 960x540. You can click the image above to see the full size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, we plan to add squids, and brainstorm (and add) more upgrades. Then, we can start polishing this game and release the first (minimal) version to get some user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Devlog"></category></entry></feed>
