<p>From October, I worked on designing and drawing skills for Gem Worlds. I think of the game as something like a cross between Boudler Dash and Hades: you dodge boulders, collect gems of different types, battle enemies, avoid enviornment-specific obstacles, and eventually escape through the portal. At the same time, you can pick from 21 different skills - a mix of active and passive - and enemies can use skills, too!</p>
<p>As a game designer, I hope the array of different skills will allow users to not only custom-pick the skills that best fit their personality and play-style, but also control the difficulty. In my previous game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342600">Oneons</a>, which I designed to be brutally hard, I added an optional heal skill in response to players complaining the game was too difficult; I hope that approach can work here, too.</p>
<p>The skills break down into two categories: active, and passive. Active skills require you to use them, and come in two variations: cooldown based (e.g. usable every 4 turns), and quantity based (e.g. only 4 uses per level). These include elemental attacks like fireball (area damage), freeze (stop monsters for a few turns) to time-bombs that explode after a few seconds.</p>
<p>Passive skills always take effect, all the time. These vary a great deal, ranging from the mundane Fireproof skill (which makes you invincible to explosions) to the game-changing Wall Walker skill (that lets you walk through walls) or the More Gems skill, which greatly increases the number of gems in a level (thus dropping the difficulty).</p>
<p>Second, I started working on the second (or third, not sure yet) world - a desert-themed world. I couldn't draw art good enough for it to be a "crystal desert," but I hope the monster art will bring that out. The video only shows the tiles and background; here are some monsters in various stages of design, from concept to final sprite:</p>
<p><img alt="six desert and/or crystal monsters" src="https://i.imgur.com/J4Qij6A.png"></p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, 21 skills, which is a lot. After the first world, which introduces the game mechanics to the player, monsters will start including their own skills - ranging from passive ones (like being explosion-proof or teleporting away if hit) to active ones that affect the player and environment in different ways.</p></li>

          <li class="list-group-item"><p>Hello! I took a month off from game development to focus on some personal, real-life things. Now that it's mostly settled, I'm back full-force into game development. I think it's fair to say, I'm working harder on this game than any I made so far.</p>
<p>As I alluded to last week, I spent a great deal of time reworking the game art. Here's a screenshot showing how the game looks now:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/FffzxK2.png"></p>
<p>Notably, you can see the main character changed, as well as all the monsters. They now follow the world theme, which is drawn partially from the over-arching game story (different worlds) - hence the finalized game name, "Gem Worlds."</p>
<p>This month, I started in earnest on the skill system. You can see how it look so far: </p>
<iframe width="728" height="410" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mASgo2hkQKs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>In the playable alpha/prototype from earlier this year, players could purchase skills between runs, using (permanent) gems earned each run. You can upgrade skills, and customize your experience - everything from more health to stronger fireballs.</p>
<p>Unlike the earlier versions, in the final game, you can only select a few skills for each run. This is to encourage players to try out different skill combinations, find synergies, upgrade the ones they like, and hopefully also customize your difficulty. You can - for example - upgrade fireballs to their max, and use them to snipe enemies from afar; or you can upgrade your health a lot, and recklessly charge into danger. (There's also an invincibility option, for anyone who wants to just see the story or complete the game more easily.)</p>
<p>The planned skills include a combination of innate abilities, as well as technological tools. There are a lot of ways in which they can interact with each other, and with the world. I hope that will lead to more interesting, fun, surprising experiences, but that also means a lot more testing to make sure the game ships bug-free.</p>
<p>That pretty much wraps it up for this month. If you're interested in the game, sign up to the <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/deengames">online newsletter</a> to get weekly updates. It's not spam, but short, to-the-point weekly progress updates.</p></li>

          <li class="list-group-item"><p>Here's me completing a single level in a new run of the gem roguelike:</p>

<p>You can see quite a lot of changes from last month. The most obvious one is the skill shop; specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting gems collects them permanently across all runs (the three types have three different values)</li>
<li>Between runs of the game, you can upgrade your skills</li>
<li>At the skill shop, you can buy new skills, upgrade existing skills, or buy other upgrades (e.g. health) with your collected gems</li>
</ul>
<p>While feedback on this ran contrary to what I hoped, I decided to make the game more roguelike (-like?) - dying three times takes you back to the beginning of the current world. Along with permanent gems, I hope this will lead players down an experience like Hades, where they adventure for a while, die, upgrade a lot, and try different builds the next run-through.</p>
<p>I also ran a limited alpha test (around six players played it and reported their feedback, incuding recordings and streams of them playing the game). Thank you all again for testing and providing feedback, be it a little or a lot - it helped me correct the course of the game and identify some much-needed things to improve upon!</p>
<p>This month, I also completed two major blocking tasks for the game: I sat down and wrote a complete end-to-end story for the game, including designing all the major characters, and some world-building/lore. Based on this, I started modifying the first world's art to fit the theme of the first world (Brightshield masjid/mosque).</p>
<p>I have a long way to go with art, which is the focus of this month: design the worlds in detail (including obstacles and monsters), and coding whatever's necessary to make it look good. This includes polishing the first world to a gleaming sheen, something I already sunk many hours into (and expect to sink many more). Already, you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>New tiles</li>
<li>A new level border</li>
<li>A large new parallax background</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope, inshaAllah (God willing), I can complete the first world art, and some of the subsequent worlds, this month. We'll see how it goes.</p>

          <li class="list-group-item"><p>What happens if you take a classic gem-collecting boulder-dodging action puzzle, make it turn-based, and add in roguelike elements like skills, monsters, and procedurally-generated levels?</p>
<p>This:</p>

<p>This is a prototype (mostly getting game systems working with placeholder or simple art) which I toiled away at for the last 30 days. Currently, it includes almost all the core systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect gems, dodge boulders, and make it to the exit without dying</li>
<li>Environmental elements to avoid, like explosive falling mines and lava pools</li>
<li>Procedurally-generated levels (five completely different level types)</li>
<li>Monsters, melee fighting, and two skills: an explosive fireball, and a stopwatch that lets you stop time for five turns.</li>
</ul>
<p>What's missing? My favourite roguelike element: the ability to spend gems to buy permanent upgrades and unlock new skills.</p>
<p>My current vision is something like a cross between Boulder Dash and Hades. You pick from an assortment of unlocked and upgraded skills, make a run, die, upgrade and pick an entirely different set, and try again. I planned 100 levels across ten different biomes, each with their own unique set of monsters and environmental dangers to deal with.</p>

          <li class="list-group-item"><p>Want to make games faster, bigger, and with better quality, while investing the same amount of time? It's possible, albeit with an unintuitive solution: a custom game engine. I'm here to tell you why you can, and should, build a custom game engine.</p>
<p>It's 2021, and lots of strong, general-purpose game engines abound: from Unreal to Godot to GameMaker to Construct, tools exist for beginner and experienced developers alike. Why bother making your own game engine?</p>
<p>It's a great learning tool, sure, but a better reason exists: you can <em>customize your game engine to your own personal style and workflow.</em></p>
<p>A great example of this is RPG Maker, which specializes in making JRPG games. Using RPG Maker, you can - very quickly, and without much coding skill - create large-scale and complex JRPGs. RPG Maker includes events for all kinds of common JRPG things (dialog, shops, inns, quest NPCs, etc.) which makes it very, very fast to build, compared to building something from scratch.</p>
<p>Even if you think this isn't a great idea, I guarantee you will learn a ton by doing this. If you're convinced, read on.</p>
<h2>Pick a Small Target</h2>
<p>You're not planning to build a general-purpose, large-scale game engines. Those are difficult, and require <a href="https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/make-a-game-engine/">lots of different skillls</a> which you may not have.</p>
<p>First, identify an existing game engine, framework, library, toolkit, etc. that you use and like. What's great about it? Importantly, what's not good about it? Where can you improve upon it, or what pain-points does it inflict on you that you wish you could work around?</p>
<p>Once you identified your starting-point, you can even build on top of an existing game engine. This way, you create a standalone library, or a thin "layer" that makes some tasks easier. It could be as simple as scene management, or as complicated as common code for a roguelike.</p>
<p>Whatever your goal, pick something small and achievable as the first step.</p>
<h2>Pick a Companion Game</h2>
<p>Now, the most important part: <strong>do not build your game engine or framework in isolation!</strong> You will end up with bloated features that are difficult to use, and code that nobody uses.  Instead, design a small standalone game that you feel really excited to build.</p>
<p>The key: build your game <em>in tandem</em> with your game engine. For example, if you need outlined text, add some code for that to your game engine, then add it to the titlescreen, options screen, or whatever location in your game that you need it.</p>
<p>This keeps your code useful, streamlined, and well-tested to begin with; it greatly increases the chances that you can ship something useful at the end of your game development cycle, whether the game ships or not.</p>
<p>Work on your game framework with that cycle: add code, test it, implement it in your game. Rinse, repeat.</p>
<h2>Use-Case</h2>
<p>If your game framework extends beyond a simple library, you should consider the user workflow carefully. How do users use your framework? Do they link a DLL, or copy/paste code into their project? Do you need to provide a template project with some starter code, or simply a spec for a JSON file?</p>
<p>Looking at this early on makes it easier for users to eventually use your game framework.</p>
<h2>Testing and Quality</h2>
<p>Testing your game framework is really important. As it grows, you will find it increasingly likely that you accidentally break things in other places and not notice. I highly recommend writing unit tests and/or integration tests for <em>every single line of code you write.</em> This makes it very easy to make changes: you simply run the tests, and they identify anything broken you need to fix.</p>
<h2>A War Story: Oneons and Puffin</h2>
<p>I applied this process to a number of game frameworks over the years (mostly abandonware). One of them, <a href="https://github.com/nightblade9/puffin-v1">Puffin</a>, actually shipped to production (I finished it and launched the game and the framework). It didn't meet my long-term needs, but it worked well enough.</p>
<p>Here's a quick summary of how that came to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target:</strong> I really like Godot. One thing that frequently bugs me is the lack of free support for exporting your game for the Nintendo Switch. I'm also not a big fan of GDscript, the internal, Python-like scripting language.</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> I decided to build something similar to Godot - a visual IDE - albeit in C#. I chose MonoGame as my base, since I've used it before, and since it has excellent free support for porting to the Switch</li>
<li><strong>Small Target:</strong> For the first version of Puffin, I decided to leverage my experience with CraftyJS and build a small, easy-to-use fluent API. I based it on Entity-Component System architecture. (This isn't a good fit for Godot-like games, which use nested nodes.)</li>
<li><strong>Start Small:</strong> I build the absolute minimum code to get started: a base entity class, and some components for rendering sprites and text. That's it.  I decided I would limit myself to no IDE or UI controls, as those require a lot of additional effort to build.</li>
<li><strong>Companion Game:</strong> I started immediately on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342600/Oneons_Prisoners/">Oneons</a>, my companion game: a tiny broughlike dungeon-crawler with 12 floors of mayhem, monsters with powers, and tactical combat. I shipped the first version of Oneons, with Puffin, in a month for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/persistent-roguelike-jam/">Persistent Game Jam</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Unit testing:</strong> Most of the Puffin code is unit-tested, and every commit builds and runs the test in Jenkins. This helped me notice when I accidentally broke things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, Puffin didn't meet my needs; in particular, the choice of an ECS architecture didn't mesh well with Godot-style nested scenes and subscenes.</p>
<p>I may revisit Puffin in the future, and I certainly learned a lot about development through this experience. I hope you, too, will find the time and effort to build something, big or small, to help you build games you like faster and better than whatever you're using today.</p></li>
