          <li class="list-group-item"><p>Hey all, just wanted to drop a quick note and let you know that Gem Worlds is pretty much content-complete. You can play the game from start to finish, and aside from some bugs and missing polish, the game is done.</p>
<p>For the next couple of months up to the release, the plan is to add missing polish (like sound design, story events, and an ending) and find/fix bugs. There won't be much to show, but it's critical work.</p>
<p>On the bright side, I am also planning to launch a demo of Gem Worlds. The demo will remain up-to-date with the rest of the game (it won't lag behind in terms of features or fixes), and I hope many of you will play it and pass along your feedback.</p>
<p>In summary, the roadmap for the next few months (other than Ramadan, which is most of April and won't include much/any gamedev) looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add sound design, story events, options, etc.</li>
<li>Launch the game demo</li>
<li>Add polish and fix bugs</li>
<li>Repeat until the game is ready for beta testing</li>
</ul></li>

<p>It's been a crazy two months since I wrote the last blog post. In the last post, I talked about the 21 skills and ten worlds. Since then, I <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858760?utm_source=blog">launched the game on Steam</a>. Based on the first month worth of metrics, it looks like the game will be a flop. (Steam gamers tend to like deep games, tend to hate puzzle games, and it looks like the roguelike aspects of this game aren't enough to lift it out of the puzzle genre.)</p>
<p>Instead of dropping the project, I decided to cut scope, and cut the number of worlds in half, from ten to five. This will save me anything from weeks to months of development, and will allow me to shine a light on other, much-needed areas - such as audio production. Plus, if players enjoy the game, I can always add more worlds and skills later.</p>
<p>That brings us to the completion of the fourth of five worlds. Here's a list of some of the interesting enemies you encounter in the third and fourth world:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ice-mimic in the ice world. It looks like an ice cube, and spawns breakable ice walls as it walks.</li>
<li>A bee-hive in the tree world; it spawns cute bees, which (sadly) can be killed, but eventually respawn.</li>
<li>A creature that waits for you to approach, and once you do, relentlessly stalks you</li>
<li>Troublesome teleporting tree pixies that hit you and teleport away</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see (if you look carefully) two ice mimics here: <img alt="ice mimimcs in the ice world" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJvTkb2XEAAXkjZ?format=jpg&amp;name=large"></p>
<p>Here's a brief preview of the fifth and final (space / spaceship) world, featuring laser fields that oscillate on and off, and damage anything inside:</p>
<p><img alt="laser field" src="https://i.imgur.com/z56vkiD.png"></p>
<p>That's it for this month! If you would like to recieve weekly updates, you can sign up to <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/deengames">my newsletter</a>. That's the best place to get updates about the game; plus, I'll be sharing the password for the beta there, when it's ready.</p></li>

<p>From October, I worked on designing and drawing skills for Gem Worlds. I think of the game as something like a cross between Boudler Dash and Hades: you dodge boulders, collect gems of different types, battle enemies, avoid enviornment-specific obstacles, and eventually escape through the portal. At the same time, you can pick from 21 different skills - a mix of active and passive - and enemies can use skills, too!</p>
<p>As a game designer, I hope the array of different skills will allow users to not only custom-pick the skills that best fit their personality and play-style, but also control the difficulty. In my previous game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342600">Oneons</a>, which I designed to be brutally hard, I added an optional heal skill in response to players complaining the game was too difficult; I hope that approach can work here, too.</p>
<p>The skills break down into two categories: active, and passive. Active skills require you to use them, and come in two variations: cooldown based (e.g. usable every 4 turns), and quantity based (e.g. only 4 uses per level). These include elemental attacks like fireball (area damage), freeze (stop monsters for a few turns) to time-bombs that explode after a few seconds.</p>
<p>Passive skills always take effect, all the time. These vary a great deal, ranging from the mundane Fireproof skill (which makes you invincible to explosions) to the game-changing Wall Walker skill (that lets you walk through walls) or the More Gems skill, which greatly increases the number of gems in a level (thus dropping the difficulty).</p>
<p>Second, I started working on the second (or third, not sure yet) world - a desert-themed world. I couldn't draw art good enough for it to be a "crystal desert," but I hope the monster art will bring that out. The video only shows the tiles and background; here are some monsters in various stages of design, from concept to final sprite:</p>
<p><img alt="six desert and/or crystal monsters" src="https://i.imgur.com/J4Qij6A.png"></p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, 21 skills, which is a lot. After the first world, which introduces the game mechanics to the player, monsters will start including their own skills - ranging from passive ones (like being explosion-proof or teleporting away if hit) to active ones that affect the player and environment in different ways.</p></li>

          <li class="list-group-item"><p>Hello! I took a month off from game development to focus on some personal, real-life things. Now that it's mostly settled, I'm back full-force into game development. I think it's fair to say, I'm working harder on this game than any I made so far.</p>
<p>As I alluded to last week, I spent a great deal of time reworking the game art. Here's a screenshot showing how the game looks now:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/FffzxK2.png"></p>
<p>Notably, you can see the main character changed, as well as all the monsters. They now follow the world theme, which is drawn partially from the over-arching game story (different worlds) - hence the finalized game name, "Gem Worlds."</p>
<p>This month, I started in earnest on the skill system. You can see how it look so far: </p>

<p>In the playable alpha/prototype from earlier this year, players could purchase skills between runs, using (permanent) gems earned each run. You can upgrade skills, and customize your experience - everything from more health to stronger fireballs.</p>
<p>Unlike the earlier versions, in the final game, you can only select a few skills for each run. This is to encourage players to try out different skill combinations, find synergies, upgrade the ones they like, and hopefully also customize your difficulty. You can - for example - upgrade fireballs to their max, and use them to snipe enemies from afar; or you can upgrade your health a lot, and recklessly charge into danger. (There's also an invincibility option, for anyone who wants to just see the story or complete the game more easily.)</p>
<p>The planned skills include a combination of innate abilities, as well as technological tools. There are a lot of ways in which they can interact with each other, and with the world. I hope that will lead to more interesting, fun, surprising experiences, but that also means a lot more testing to make sure the game ships bug-free.</p>
<p>That pretty much wraps it up for this month. If you're interested in the game, sign up to the <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/deengames">online newsletter</a> to get weekly updates. It's not spam, but short, to-the-point weekly progress updates.</p></li>

          <li class="list-group-item"><p>Here's me completing a single level in a new run of the gem roguelike:</p>

<p>You can see quite a lot of changes from last month. The most obvious one is the skill shop; specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting gems collects them permanently across all runs (the three types have three different values)</li>
<li>Between runs of the game, you can upgrade your skills</li>
<li>At the skill shop, you can buy new skills, upgrade existing skills, or buy other upgrades (e.g. health) with your collected gems</li>
</ul>
<p>While feedback on this ran contrary to what I hoped, I decided to make the game more roguelike (-like?) - dying three times takes you back to the beginning of the current world. Along with permanent gems, I hope this will lead players down an experience like Hades, where they adventure for a while, die, upgrade a lot, and try different builds the next run-through.</p>
<p>I also ran a limited alpha test (around six players played it and reported their feedback, incuding recordings and streams of them playing the game). Thank you all again for testing and providing feedback, be it a little or a lot - it helped me correct the course of the game and identify some much-needed things to improve upon!</p>
<p>This month, I also completed two major blocking tasks for the game: I sat down and wrote a complete end-to-end story for the game, including designing all the major characters, and some world-building/lore. Based on this, I started modifying the first world's art to fit the theme of the first world (Brightshield masjid/mosque).</p>
<p>I have a long way to go with art, which is the focus of this month: design the worlds in detail (including obstacles and monsters), and coding whatever's necessary to make it look good. This includes polishing the first world to a gleaming sheen, something I already sunk many hours into (and expect to sink many more). Already, you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>New tiles</li>
<li>A new level border</li>
<li>A large new parallax background</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope, inshaAllah (God willing), I can complete the first world art, and some of the subsequent worlds, this month. We'll see how it goes.</p>
