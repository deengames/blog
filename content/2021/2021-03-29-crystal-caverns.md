Introducing Crystal Caverns, a match-3/roguelike hybrid with persistent upgrades. In the last two months, I took this game from a rough prototype to what you see in the video. At present, the game includes:

- A bare-bones battle system: players and monsters take turns attacking.
- A basic match-3 game with collapse mechanics, albeit you can swap any two tiles
- Victory and defeat
- Persistent currency (crystal shards) which you retain across battles

Battles appear bare-bones at the moment, but include some depth: 
- Players can attack, critical-strike, boost defense, poison enemies, drain, and heal.
- Monster attacks affect the board in various ways (currently, they just eat random tiles).

That includes enough of the core game to improve upon.

Next month, I plan to turn my attention more towards the roguelike side of the game: generating dungeons with monsters, finding treasure (including persistent treasure), and balancing exploration with progression.
