Hello! Long-time readers of this blog may notice a couple of changes:

- A new, mobile-responsive theme
- A complete restructuring of content

I decided to redo the blog to make it mobile-friendly, and to hange the content - instead of game development notes and game design articles, instead, I plan to focus on my games.

What can you expect going forward? Weekly posts show-casing the best of whatever current project I'm working on.

Old articles will stay available for a while.
