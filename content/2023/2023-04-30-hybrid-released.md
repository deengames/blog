Hey all. It's been a while, so here are some updates:

- First, Eid Mubarak to everyone who fasted and/or celebrates. May Allah accept your fasting, prayers, and all your good deeds this and every Ramadan (ameen)
- Tomorrow (May 1st) marks the conclusion of the Games for Blind Gamers 2 jam. You can check out the jam games, which are a mix of audio games, text games, and 2D/3D games, here: https://itch.io/jam/games-for-blind-gamers-2
- I completed and submitted my entry, Hybrid

Yep, that's right, a new game! It's a text game, and a combination of roguelike and MUDs - perhaps the evolution of my previous prototype, which included interactive-fiction-like puzzle elements.

If you're interested in trying it out, you can play it on Itch: https://deengames.itch.io/hybrid - please let me know if you have any feedback.
