As announced in December last year, Gem Worlds ships on January 16, 2023 (in just three days). This version matches the corresponding v1.0.1 demo, which includes a number of bug-fixes.

Unfortunately, adding gamepad (and full keyboard) support took a lot longer than anticipated. While I made major strides in updating and modernizing the main menu, I didn't fully finish the changes, and it's buggy enough that I'm going to hold off on releasing an update.

The plan for the next release, v1.1.0, still includes full gamepad, keyboard, and mouse support for the entire game. I'm quite burned out from working on the game for 18 months, but I'll see how much farther I can go with it.

Thanks for your support, and see you at release!
