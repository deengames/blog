Gem Worlds v1.2.0 ships later today (both the full game and the demo). This version includes gamepad and keyboard support everywhere - in game, options, and menus - as well as some fixes:

- Fix: in rare cases, a room-based level may have inaccessible areas
- Fix: level selection menu correctly appears post-game

Please note that the controls rebinding menu shows all controls (keyboard and gamepad), but rebinding gamepad controls currently doesn't work (and I can't figure out why). If this is an issue for you, please contact me and let me know.
