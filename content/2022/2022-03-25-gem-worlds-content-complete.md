Hey all, just wanted to drop a quick note and let you know that Gem Worlds is pretty much content-complete. You can play the game from start to finish, and aside from some bugs and missing polish, the game is done.

For the next couple of months up to the release, the plan is to add missing polish (like sound design, story events, and an ending) and find/fix bugs. There won't be much to show, but it's critical work.

On the bright side, I am also planning to launch a demo of Gem Worlds. The demo will remain up-to-date with the rest of the game (it won't lag behind in terms of features or fixes), and I hope many of you will play it and pass along your feedback.

In summary, the roadmap for the next few months (other than Ramadan, which is most of April and won't include much/any gamedev) looks like:

- Add sound design, story events, options, etc.
- Launch the game demo
- Add polish and fix bugs
- Repeat until the game is ready for beta testing
