v1.0 ships today, and includes a major change in how skills work. Instead of saving up gems across multiple levels and buying skills from the shop, you now learn a new skill every other level. You get to pick between upgrading two previously learned skills, or learning one new skill. You also get to change your equipped skills. I hope this will encourage more experimentation with skills.

This version also includes several smaller changes;

- You can choose between multiple save slots. All your existing progress is placed in the first slot.
- You have unlimited lives and no longer can get game over
- Each world generates only two types of levels
- Removed background music and options
- Options scroll vertically
- (Accessibility) you can disable the gradient shader for tiles, which makes it much easier to see what's going on

This release also includes a slew of bug fixes. The most important ones are listed below.

- Fixed a soft lock when you push a boulder into the exit
- Fixed a soft lock when you push a mine into an explosion
- Pressing space rapidly while next to a monster no longer makes other monsters move erratically.
- Moving non-stop no longer causes some boulders to defy gravity and dance up and down
- Clicking on skill buttons correctly activates skills
- Pushing a tipped boulder upward into a teleporter no longer causes it to dance up and down
- Fixed janky monster movement if you hit a monster and immediately move
