Hey all, just a quick update: the game testing is progressing well. I've finished a full play-through of the game (2 hours and 23 minutes, not including dying, restarting, etc.) which is a lot longer than my previous games (20-30 minutes).

I've fixed all the bugs I know about (except one). Once that's done, if I get a clean run through the game without any bugs, the game goes out the door.

Exciting!

Meanwhile, check out this rare bug I fixed, where a Bomb Bot directly following another Bomb Bot can end up walking on top of a time bomb, if the first bot drops it.
