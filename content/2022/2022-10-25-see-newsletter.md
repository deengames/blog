After struggling to blog regularly for most of the year, and grappling with the question of *how is this different from my newsletter?* I decided to make the obvious change: as of now, I'm combining my blog and newsletter, together, into the newsletter.

This means:

- Consolidated content, with a clearer picture of what state my games are in!
- More frequent updates if you're used to my blogging schedule (once every month? or less?)
- Less frequent, but bigger updates, if you're used to reading my newsletter
- Content delivered to your inbox, instead of having to open a browser or RSS reader

If you haven't already, you can sign up for my newsletter (I won't spam you, promise) or read it online [at Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/deengames).
