v1.0.1 of the demo ships today. This build primarily includes bug-fixes, including:

- Fixed a rare case where you spawn under a lock
- Fixed a rare case where boulders slide over a one-tile gap
- Newly-learned skills sometimes appear at level 2
- Light crystals run out of turns but light doesn't dim
- A few UI bugs related to skills
