Hey all, my apologies for not writing sooner - I thought I sent an update out, but apparently not. In short order, here’s what’s going on with Gem Worlds:

- Still aiming for a 1.0 release this year, although not 100% sure I will be able to hit it
- Will likely release the game for free instead of paid
- Every world now generates with two types of levels, instead of all five
- The save/load screen is finished and works well!
- I fixed a lot of bugs. Like, a lot.

Here’s the save/load screen in all its current glory:
