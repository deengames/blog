- Religion in general is something many people frown on
- Especially in games, it's shunned
- Many people have made poorly-disguised propaganda things using religion
- At the same time, Muslims are often portrayed as terrorists in media
- Games are no better (FPS antagonist is often us, no longer nazis)
- Knowing all this, important to counter stereotypes and negativity
- Games as a mass-media or micro-media can definitely do that
- Our mission is not propaganda or poorly-disguised games, but actually fun, innovative, unique games that also include Muslim culture/history (names/places/events/etc.) 
- My specific passion is to leave the player with an understanding and practical application of ayaat through games (which can construct arbitrary scenarios)

Advantages to doing this: 
- It breaks stereotypes
- It normalizes us in culture (eg. hijab characters in games)
- Breaks the old stereotypes/tropes of fantasy/sci-fi (eg. jinns instead of goblins)

Doesn't appeal to everyone. Downsides include:
- This can break immersion sometimes
- DOesn't appeal to everyone (niche or sub-niche)
- Takes practice to do right
- Not every ayah is a good fit for a game

We are not alone. Other poeple put their ideologies in too (just browse Itch and see for yourself).
